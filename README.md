Proposed Solution
Our objective is to reorder graph nodes and columns to improve data locality by using these algorithms.
1.	 Reverse Cuthill McKee: using a bandwidth of a matrix refers to the width of the band around the diagonal where all the non-zero elements are located. In s sparse matrix, most elements are zero, and the non-zero elements are concentrated around the diagonal.
2.	 Fiedler Vector: calculating the second eigenvector contributes to the solution.
3.	 Customized Graph Algorithm :  it provides a linear ordering graph.
